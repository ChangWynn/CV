#### Self-Motivation
- Self-driven attitude and highly disciplined with a strong commitment to setting and achieving objectives.

As someone who enjoys running, I understand the importance of having clear goals as they provide the motivation needed to push through.

- Excellent verbal and written communication skills demonstrated through team projects during the Software Engineer Bootcamp.
- Active engagement with communication tools, such as Slack, by consistently interacting with my peers.
- Proactive sharing of useful information and resources with the team to enhance collaboration and knowledge sharing.

I actively engaged with our communication tools, such as Slack, by consistently asking and answering questions. I made a point to share any information or resources that I found useful or helpful to the team. Recognizing the importance of clear and efficient communication, I proactively initiated calls or meetings when necessary to ensure effective collaboration and alignment among team members.

#### Problem-Solving
- Analytical approach to problem-solving, I have a natural aptitude for breaking down complex problems into manageable components.
- Performance-oriented mindset, I prioritise solutions that account for factors such as time complexity and scalability.
- Continuous practice on programming exercise platforms such as CodeWars and CoderBytes to sharpen problem-solving skills.
- Exceptional resilience, I excel in maintaining composure and focus under pressure, keeping productivity and problem-solving effective.

I have achieved a 4kyu ranking on CodeWars with 800+ honor points and completed over 70 challenges on CoderByte which incorporate the Big O notation to analyze and improve coding efficiency.

#### Growth Mindset
- Embrace challenges as opportunities for personal growth and professional development.
- Embrace feedback and constructive criticism to foster improvement.

I proctively participated in code reviews assessed by experienced professionals to enhance code quality and improve developement process.

#### Continuous Learning
- Genuine enthusiasm for learning new technologies and staying up-to-date with industry trends.
